Backups are automatically made every time saving changes results in a file being overwritten. The previous content of the file is copied to a backup file with a filename such as `\MyData\index.html_backup\index.20150107172517000.html`.

The backup filename is composed of the filename plus a date string, like this:

```
index.20150109082810000.html
```

The backup pathname is configurable in <$button>
<$action-sendmessage $message="tiddlydesktop-open-config-window" tiddler="$:/TiddlyDesktop/ControlPanel"/>
Control Panel
</$button>.

You can store backups in a subfolder relative to each file like this:

```
./$filename$_backup/
```

Or you can store backups in a centralised location like this:

```
/Users/me/TiddlyBackups/
```

By including the `$filepath$` in the backup path you can automatically create subfolders for each parent folder of the file being backed up. The result is pathnames such as `Users/me/TiddlyBackups/Users/me/myWikis/index.html/index.20150109082810000.html`.

```
/Users/me/TiddlyBackups/$filepath$
```
